# Wordle - Cloud-based Wordle Game Application

Our aim is to build a fully functional Cloud-based Wordle Game App which will be implemented using Google Cloud technology. We aimed to design the game in which players have 4-8 attempts to guess a 4-8 letters word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of coloured tiles.
